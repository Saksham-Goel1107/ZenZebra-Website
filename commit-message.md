# Husky Pre-Commit Hooks

## Overview

We use [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/) to run automated checks before each commit to ensure code quality and consistency. This document explains what these checks are and how to work with them.

## Available Hooks

### Pre-Commit Hooks

When you run `git commit`, the following checks are automatically executed:

1. **lint-staged**: Runs linters and formatters only on the files that are staged for commit
   - Lints JavaScript/TypeScript files with ESLint
   - Checks TypeScript types

2. **commitlint**: Validates that commit messages follow our conventions

### Commit Message Format

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Examples:
- `feat: add dark mode support`
- `fix: resolve login button not working on mobile`
- `docs: update README with new API details`
- `chore: update dependencies`

Common types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features
- `perf`: Performance improvements
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

## How to Use

### Normal Workflow

Husky is set up to run automatically when you commit. Simply stage your changes and commit as usual:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically.

### Bypassing Hooks

In rare cases, you may need to bypass the hooks (not recommended):

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add new feature" --no-verify
```

### If Hooks Fail

If pre-commit hooks fail:

1. Read the error messages to understand what failed
2. Fix the issues in your code
3. Stage the fixed files and try committing again

Common issues:
- ESLint errors: Run `npm run lint:fix` to automatically fix many issues
- Prettier formatting: Run `npm run format` to format your code
- TypeScript errors: Run `npm run typecheck` to check for type errors
- Invalid commit message: Follow the conventional commits format

## Troubleshooting

### Hook Not Running

If hooks aren't running:

1. Make sure Husky is installed: `npm run prepare`
2. Check that the hooks are executable: `chmod +x .husky/*`
3. Ensure git hooks are enabled: `git config core.hooksPath .husky`

### Configuration Files

The relevant configuration files:

- `.husky/pre-commit`: The pre-commit hook script
- `.lintstagedrc.js`: Configuration for lint-staged
- `commitlint.config.js`: Rules for commit message validation
- `.eslintrc.js`: ESLint configuration
- `.prettierrc.js`: Prettier configuration

## Branch Name Check (Husky)

Before you can commit, Husky enforces a branch naming convention to keep the repository organized and make it easier to understand the purpose of each branch.

### Allowed Branch Name Patterns

Your branch name **must** match one of the following patterns:

- `feature/<something>`
- `fix/<something>`
- `chore/<something>`
- `refactor/<something>`
- `test/<something>`
- `hotfix/<something>`
- `release/<something>`

Where `<something>` is a short, descriptive name using lowercase letters, numbers, and dashes (e.g., `feature/login-page`, `fix/button-bug`).

#### Examples of Valid Branch Names
- `feature/add-dark-mode`
- `fix/navbar-overlap`
- `chore/update-deps`
- `refactor/user-service`
- `test/auth-flow`
- `hotfix/critical-bug`
- `release/v1.0.0`

#### Examples of Invalid Branch Names
- `dev`
- `my-feature`
- `feature_foo`
- `feature/`
- `feature`

### Why This Matters
- **Clarity:** Makes it easy to see what each branch is for at a glance
- **Automation:** Enables better CI/CD and release automation
- **Consistency:** Keeps the repo clean and easy to navigate

### Troubleshooting
- If you are sure you need to bypass this check (not recommended), you can use:
  ```bash
  git commit --no-verify
  ```
  But this should only be used in rare, justified cases.

- If you have trouble renaming your branch, see the [git branch documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-branch#_rename_a_branch).

## Benefits

Using these hooks ensures:

- Consistent code style across the project
- Early detection of issues
- Clean git history with meaningful commit messages
- Better collaboration with other contributors

By following these standards, we make the codebase more maintainable and collaboration more efficient.
